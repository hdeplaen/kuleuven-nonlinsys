{\Large \bf General guidelines}
\\ \\
This course is evaluated by means of a set of homework assignments (the student is required to make an individual report), which involve the study of a number of dynamical systems via analytical derivations, numerical simulations and bifurcation calculations. In order to help you getting through these assignments, a number of guided sessions are organized. \\ \\
Each session is focused around one exercise, and is meant to get you started. It is impossible to finish the exercise within the session; instead, you should make sure that you know how to proceed independently. Also, at the beginning of each session, we will take a little time to deal with questions regarding the previous exercise. You are therefore encouraged not to leave the assignments until the end of the semester. Note that we cannot (and do not intend to) give all the answers to the assignments during the exercise sessions, since these count as the examination.
